# My Story

Hi, This is a W.I.P project that is legitimately a story written in Python.

This is a simple project to test my knowledge and i'm learning along the way, maybe some bigger ideas later (like a community driven story maker ðŸ‘€. This is also being improved over time. Expect a Finished story. ðŸ‘€

# __NEWSFLASH!!!__

It's out!!! (not complete but it will be finished)

This also only really has Linux Support so if you are a Windows or Mac user. It's best you wait until my peabrain can figure out how to create Windows and Mac Support.

# Prerequisites

> ~ Python3

# Arch Linux (AUR)
`$ sudo pacman -S python3`

# Ubuntu and Ubuntu Based systems
`sudo apt install python3`

> ~  A Terminal of your choice.

> ~  Enough brain compacity and bravery to use a terminal/

> ~  Enough brain compacity to Copy and Paste.

> ~  To be able to clone the repository

# Every System Ever (probably)
`git clone https://github.com/4kae/story.git`

If you have all the prerequisites and aren't deficit of the prerequisites. Let's get started.

Now assuming you have all the prerequisties and have a working Linux system (with a terminal). We can get started on really launching this project.

Now, once the cloning has been done. You can really get down to the meat and potatoes of the situation which is running the script

Now to do this you're going to have to imput this command into your terminal

`cd story/ && ./story.sh`

There we go, you actually did something productive, here's a superficial, non-existing medal.
