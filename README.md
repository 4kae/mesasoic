# Mesasoic

Hi, This is a project that is a story written in Python.

This is a simple project to test my knowledge and i'm learning along the way, maybe some bigger ideas later (like a community driven story contributing system) ðŸ‘€. This is also being improved over time so pop in every now and again. ðŸ‘€

 __NEWSFLASH!!!__

It's out!!! (not complete but it will be finished)

This also only really has Linux Support so if you are a Windows or Mac user. It's best you wait until my peabrain can figure out how to create Windows and Mac Support.

# Prerequisites

> ~ Python3

 Arch Linux (AUR)
`sudo pacman -S python3`

 Ubuntu and Ubuntu Based systems
`sudo apt install python3`

> ~  Git

Unbuntu and derivitaves 
`sudo apt install git`

Arch Linux (AUR) and it's derivitaves
`sudo pacman -S git`

> ~  A Terminal of your choice.

> ~  Enough brain compacity and bravery to use a terminal.

> ~  Enough brain compacity to Copy and Paste.

> ~  To be able to clone the repository.

 Every System Ever (probably)
`git clone https://github.com/4kae/story.git`

# After getting the prerequisties
After getting and having all the prerequisites and aren't deficit of ANY prerequisites. Let's get started.

Now assuming you have all the prerequisties and have a working Linux system (with a terminal) (this is basically mandated i don't even know why i have to do this). We can get started on really launching this project.

Once the cloning has been done. You can really get down to the meat and potatoes of the situation which is running the script

Now to do this you're going to have to imput this command into your terminal

`cd mesasoic/ && ./story.sh`

There we go, you actually did something productive, here's a superficial, non-existing medal.

# This is not finished so if you find errors, set up an issue so I can get to it as fast as i can.
